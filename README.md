# DailyCodingProblem

Solutions to questions in the book [Daily Coding Problem]( https://www.amazon.com/dp/1793296634) by Alex Miller and Lawrence Wu

Every day I try to complete one problem from the book, and write a javascript solution.

This repo contains solutions by chapter number.
e.g. **Question 5.1: Implement an LRU cache** is implemented in [5-1.js](5-1.js).
